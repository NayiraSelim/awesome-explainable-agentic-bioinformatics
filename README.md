- **"Assessing the Utility of Large Language Models for Phenotype-Driven Gene Prioritization in the Diagnosis of Rare Genetic Disease"**, 2025  
  `rare-disease-diagnosis, gene-prioritization, hpo, llms, clinical-genomics`  
  — This study systematically evaluates five LLMs—GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Llama2-70B—for phenotype-driven gene prioritization, a core task in diagnosing rare genetic disorders. The authors assess performance across task completeness, gene ranking accuracy, and adherence to required output structures using multiple prompting strategies, phenotypic input formats (free text vs. standardized HPO concepts), and task difficulty levels. Despite improvements with larger models and more sophisticated prompts, GPT-4 achieves only 17% accuracy in identifying the causal gene within the top 50 predictions—substantially lower than traditional tools such as Phenomizer, Exomiser, AMELIE, and Phen2Gene, which rely on curated phenotype–gene knowledge graphs. The study finds that free-text input yields better-than-random predictions but remains slightly inferior to structured HPO input. Neither retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) nor few-shot prompting improves performance, and complex prompts reduce output-structure compliance. Bias analyses reveal a strong preference for highly studied genes (e.g., BRCA1, TP53, PTEN). Using a post-2023 dataset confirms the robustness of findings and reduces concerns about training-data leakage. The study concludes that while LLMs generate coherent rationales and can support hypothesis generation, they are not yet reliable replacements for dedicated phenotype-gene prioritization tools in clinical genomics.

- **"Large Language Models Facilitate the Generation of Electronic Health Record Phenotyping Algorithms"**, 2024  
  `ehr-phenotyping, clinical-informatics, llms, sql-generation, structured-health-data`  
  — This study evaluates the ability of four LLMs—GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude 2, and Bard—to generate computable electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping algorithms expressed as SQL queries aligned with a common data model (CDM). Phenotyping experts assessed LLM-generated algorithms for three clinical conditions (type 2 diabetes, dementia, and hypothyroidism) across instruction following, concept identification, logic accuracy, and executability. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 outperformed Claude 2 and Bard, showing strong capabilities in identifying relevant clinical concepts such as diagnosis codes, medications, and lab measurements, and translating them into CDM-compatible SQL structures. However, both GPT models struggled with constructing logically coherent inclusion/exclusion criteria, often producing algorithms that were either overly restrictive (low recall) or overly permissive (low PPV). Implementation of the top-rated LLM-generated algorithms demonstrated that expert review and refinement remain necessary to achieve clinically valid phenotypes comparable to the eMERGE gold-standard algorithms. The study highlights LLMs’ potential to accelerate early-stage phenotyping—particularly literature synthesis and initial rule drafting—while emphasizing the continued need for clinical and informatics expertise to ensure reliability and reproducibility in EHR-based research.

- **"Advancing Plant Biology Through Deep Learning–Powered Natural Language Processing"**, 2024  
  `plant-biology, protein-language-models, dna-llms, deep-learning, agricultural-bioinformatics`  
  — This perspective highlights the growing impact of deep learning—particularly large language models (LLMs) and protein language models (PLMs)—on plant biology and agricultural genomics. The authors describe how transformer-based PLMs enable large-scale representation learning directly from DNA and protein sequences, capturing multiscale structural, functional, and evolutionary patterns that traditional computational methods fail to model. These models support tasks such as regulatory motif identification, protein structure–function inference, variant impact prediction, and trait-associated sequence analysis. The article emphasizes their relevance for accelerating crop improvement, enabling model-guided genome editing, and uncovering biological mechanisms underlying complex plant traits. By integrating LLM-powered analyses with existing plant omics datasets, researchers can enhance predictions of gene function, understand plant cell systems, and design strategies for sustainable agroecological transitions. The authors argue that deep learning, anchored by LLMs and PLMs, will play a central role in future plant sciences, bridging molecular biology with large-scale agricultural applications while requiring continued human oversight due to ethical, regulatory, and interpretability considerations.

- **"WEFormer: Classification for physiological time series with small sample sizes based on wavelet decomposition and time series foundation models"**, 2025  
  `physiological-time-series, tsfm, wavelet-decomposition, small-sample-learning, transformer-models`  
  — This study introduces WEFormer, a physiological time-series classification framework designed specifically for scenarios with extremely limited sample sizes, a common challenge in biomedical research due to high data-collection cost, privacy restrictions, and difficulty recruiting subjects. The model integrates a pretrained Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM; MOMENT) with frozen weights as a universal feature extractor, allowing the architecture to leverage rich temporal representations without overfitting. In parallel, WEFormer incorporates a differentiable MODWT wavelet decomposition module that separates input signals into multi-frequency sub-bands; a learnable attention mechanism dynamically emphasizes informative frequency components while suppressing noise, enabling robust feature learning even from low-quality wearable-device signals such as GSR and ECG. The approach avoids task-specific priors required by meta-learning or prototypical methods and instead combines generalized pretrained embeddings with adaptive spectral filtering. Extensive experiments on two multimodal datasets—WESAD for emotion recognition and MOCAS for cognitive workload estimation—show substantial accuracy improvements over prior deep-learning and augmentation-based methods under small-sample conditions. Ablation studies confirm that TSFM embeddings and wavelet-attention decomposition are both central to WEFormer’s performance, demonstrating the value of foundation time-series models for practical clinical and affective-computing applications with limited data.

- **"Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labeling compares favorably with large language models for regulatory sequence prediction"**, 2025  
  `regulatory-genomics, semi-supervised-learning, pseudo-labeling, cross-species-alignment, dnabert2-benchmarking`  
  — This work proposes a cross-species semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that substantially expands training data for regulatory sequence prediction by pseudo-labeling homologous regions across mammalian genomes, addressing the fundamental limitation that supervised deep learning relies on scarce functional genomic labels constrained by the finite size of the human genome. The method remaps annotated regulatory sequences (e.g., TF-binding peaks) from human to closely related genomes, generating large-scale pseudo-labeled datasets for model pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on the original labeled human data. An enhancement inspired by the Noisy Student algorithm estimates pseudo-label confidence and particularly improves performance for transcription factors with very small training sets. The SSL paradigm is architecture-agnostic and was applied to DeepBind, DeepSEA, and DNABERT2, consistently yielding stronger sequence-classification accuracy and improved SNP-effect prediction across multiple TFs and assays. Notably, compact SSL-trained models achieved performance matching or surpassing large DNA language models such as DNABERT2, highlighting that data-efficient SSL pretraining can rival or outperform computationally expensive self-supervised LLMs trained on many genomes. The study demonstrates that evolutionary conservation provides a powerful signal for regulatory model scaling without the heavy resource cost of large LLM pretraining.

- **"From text to traits: exploring the role of large language models in plant breeding"**, 2024  
  `plant-breeding, plant-omics, llms, multimodal-integration, genetic-relationship-mining`  
  — This review examines how large language models, originally designed for natural language understanding, can be repurposed as computational engines for uncovering complex genetic, phenotypic, and environmental interactions in modern plant breeding. The paper outlines how LLMs and foundational transformer architectures can ingest heterogeneous biological information—multi-omics, field phenotyping, environmental metadata, and genomic variation—to reveal non-linear genotype–phenotype relationships, infer novel genetic interactions, and improve trait-performance prediction. By treating biological sequences, trait descriptions, and environmental conditions as structured "text," LLMs can build unified latent representations that enhance selection strategies compared to traditional quantitative genetics approaches. The author highlights the potential of LLM-driven knowledge graph construction, multimodal data fusion, and zero-shot reasoning to support breeders in decision-making, accelerate discovery of beneficial alleles, and enable more sustainable crop-improvement pipelines. Despite these opportunities, the review emphasizes challenges including limited plant-specific training corpora, data heterogeneity, scarcity of labeled phenotypic datasets, and risks of hallucinations, ultimately framing LLMs as an emerging but still underexplored direction for advancing computational plant breeding.

- **"Large AI Models in Health Informatics: Applications, Challenges, and the Future"**, 2023, JBHI

The authors analyze how these models, exemplified by ChatGPT-scale architectures, reshape methodologies across seven major sectors: bioinformatics, medical diagnosis, medical imaging, EHR-based informatics, medical education, public health, and medical robotics. The review highlights how transformer-based large models integrate heterogeneous biological and clinical data (genomics, imaging, structured EHRs, medical text), enabling improved prediction, reasoning, and decision-support across health workflows. It also discusses architectural advances, self-supervised pretraining approaches, and cross-modal representations that underpin the scalability and adaptability of foundation models in healthcare. Despite their rapid progress, the paper emphasizes critical challenges—including robustness, bias, hallucinations, data scarcity for specialized diseases, privacy constraints, and computational cost—while offering forward-looking insights on safe deployment, regulatory considerations, and the role of trustworthy, clinically aligned large models in the future of health informatics.

- **"Deciphering enzymatic potential in metagenomic reads through DNA language models"**, 2024  
  `dna-llms, metagenomics, enzymatic-annotation, foundation-models, read-level-analysis`  
  — This study introduces two transformer-based DNA language models—REMME, a foundational model pretrained on raw metagenomic reads to learn contextual DNA representations, and REBEAN, a fine-tuned enzymatic-function annotator that predicts enzyme activities directly from unassembled metagenomic reads. Unlike traditional reference-based pipelines that depend on sequence homology, curated databases, or assembled contigs, REBEAN identifies functional signatures in short reads by focusing on molecular function rather than strict gene identity. The models demonstrate strong generalization to both known and orphan sequences, uncovering functionally relevant subsequences even without explicit supervision. Importantly, REBEAN expands enzymatic annotation coverage for environmental metagenomes and enables the discovery of previously uncharacterized enzymes, offering a reference-free strategy for probing microbial functional “dark matter”.

- **"Natural language processing data services for healthcare providers"**, 2024

  — This paper presents a first-of-its-kind clinical NLP service deployed within the UK National Health Service (NHS), designed as an integrated data-processing and annotation framework to align machine learning workflows with real clinical environments. Using harmonised parallel platforms, the authors developed a scalable infrastructure for clinical text annotation, data quality management, and model refinement. The system distils expert clinician knowledge into NLP models through continuous annotation cycles, resulting in more than **26,086 manual annotations across 556 SNOMED-CT concepts**. The service primarily leverages named entity recognition (NER) for extracting diagnoses, procedures, and clinical attributes from unstructured EHR text, enabling downstream operational and clinical decision-support applications. By embedding NLP capabilities directly into provider workflows, the approach improves data accessibility, informs analytics, and supports broader adoption of AI-driven healthcare solutions. The authors argue that such vertically integrated NLP services will soon become standard components of healthcare delivery infrastructures.

- **"Deciphering genomic codes using advanced NLP techniques: a scoping review"**, 2024  
  `genomics-nlp, dna-tokenization, transformers, llms, regulatory-annotation, dna-language-models`  
  — This scoping review synthesizes recent efforts applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to genomic sequencing data analysis. Surveying 26 studies published between 2021 and 2024, the paper highlights how DNA tokenization strategies (k-mers, adaptive tokenizers, byte-pair encodings), together with transformer architectures, improve the representation of genomic sequences by capturing long-range dependencies and regulatory patterns. The reviewed models demonstrate strong performance in predicting functional genomic annotations, including transcription-factor binding, chromatin accessibility, enhancer/promoter states, and variant-effect inference. The authors emphasize that transformer-based genomics models enable scalable processing of large sequencing data and facilitate regulatory code interpretation, yet challenges remain in transparency, dataset accessibility, model bias, and biological interpretability. The review positions genomic NLP as a rapidly emerging field with significant potential to advance precision medicine through automated, high-resolution analysis of noncoding regulatory regions.

- **"Review and reconciliation: A proof-of-concept investigation"**, 2025  
  `clinical-llms, medication-review, drug-safety, pharmacogenomics, decision-support`  
  — This proof-of-concept study evaluates the ability of four large language models—ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude-Instant, and Llama—to support medication review and reconciliation workflows. The authors assessed LLM performance across key pharmacotherapy tasks, including detection of dosing-regimen errors, identification of drug–drug interactions, therapeutic-drug-monitoring (TDM)–based dose adjustments, and genomics-guided individualized dosing. Outputs were evaluated using predefined criteria (accuracy, relevance, risk-management behavior, hallucination control, and citation quality). Results show variable but generally consistent model behavior: ChatGPT demonstrated high accuracy in most dosing-error scenarios; all LLMs correctly identified warfarin-related interactions but collectively missed the clinically important metoprolol–verapamil interaction. Claude-Instant provided the most appropriate recommendations for TDM-based regimen adjustment and pharmacogenomic decision-making, while Gemini was notable for spontaneously including citations and guideline references, enhancing interpretability. Error-impact analysis revealed minor safety implications for dosing-regimen and TDM tasks, but potentially major consequences for missed drug–drug interactions or incorrect pharmacogenomic recommendations. The study highlights both the promise and current limitations of LLMs as medication-review assistants and underscores the need for validated integration into EHR and prescribing systems to ensure safe deployment in clinical workflows.

  - **"Selection of Coordination Mechanisms in Intelligent Environments"**, 2024  
  `multi-agent-systems, coordination-mechanisms, intelligent-environments, system-integration, medical-monitoring`
  — This paper presents a framework for selecting appropriate coordination mechanisms to enable interoperability and migration of users and services across multiple multi-agent systems (MAS) within intelligent environments, with a particular focus on medical monitoring ecosystems. While traditional MAS research largely addresses coordination within a single society of agents, this work highlights the unresolved challenge of coordinating interactions *between* distinct agent societies operating in dynamic, heterogeneous environments. The authors analyze existing coordination strategies—understood as local policies that govern workload distribution and task execution—and emphasize that no single mechanism is suitable for all scenarios, especially when system requirements change at runtime. Their proposed framework guides designers in choosing coordination mechanisms by considering environmental dynamism, system constraints, and interoperability needs. A case study involving user migration across interconnected smart spaces demonstrates how the framework supports integration decisions in complex intelligent ecosystems, including those supporting healthcare monitoring. Although the work does not provide quantitative benchmarks or empirical performance evaluations, it addresses a critical gap in MAS integration theory, offering a structured methodology for managing cross-system coordination. Limitations include the absence of formal validation, scalability studies, and evaluation against alternative decision frameworks. Overall, the paper contributes an important conceptual tool for designing coherent, cooperative MAS architectures in smart healthcare and other intelligent environments.

- **"A Multi-Agent System for Ubiquitous Learning for Hospital Education"**  
  `multi-agent-systems, ubiquitous-learning, context-awareness, hospital-education, cloud-computing`
  — This paper presents MASUL, a multi-agent ubiquitous learning framework designed to modernize hospital education by leveraging mobile computing, cloud infrastructure, and context-aware intelligent agents to deliver personalized instructional content to patients and clinicians. Motivated by escalating healthcare costs and the limitations of conventional Healthcare Information Systems (HIS), the study highlights how advances in mobile technology and cloud computing have enabled ubiquitous learning environments capable of dynamically adapting to users’ physical and physiological context—including location, time, temperature, blood pressure, glucose levels, and heart rate—thereby supporting situationally appropriate training, guidance, and self-care reinforcement. MASUL is implemented using the JADE agent-development framework, enabling autonomous agents to acquire contextual signals, collaborate, reason, and proactively initiate educational interactions such as pain-relief support, emotional reassurance, and instruction in lifesaving procedures (e.g., cardiac massage). The authors emphasize key architectural considerations for smart u-learning agents, including reactivity, proactiveness, social communication, and alignment with technical, organizational, and human–social constraints inherent in clinical settings. Although the work does not include empirical datasets, benchmarks, or comparative evaluations, it conceptualizes MASUL as a robust infrastructure that simplifies access to learning content via mobile interfaces, enhances responsiveness of ubiquitous learning systems, and optimizes user queries across heterogeneous clinical contexts. The paper underscores that technical sophistication alone is insufficient; effective deployment of MAS in hospital education must address usability, interaction design, real-world variability in clinical environments, and broader sociotechnical challenges. Major limitations include the absence of security and privacy analysis, lack of performance validation, untested scalability, and no assessment of integration with existing HIS platforms. Overall, MASUL is presented as a promising yet unvalidated paradigm that requires future empirical testing, context-aware evaluation metrics, and human-centered development to achieve reliable and scalable use in hospital learning ecosystems.

- **"Multi-Agent System as a New Approach to Effective Chronic Heart Failure Management: Key Considerations"**  
  `multi-agent-systems, chronic-heart-failure, disease-management, telemonitoring, intelligent-healthcare`
  — This review provides an in-depth examination of how multi-agent systems (MAS) can serve as a computational paradigm for advancing chronic heart failure (CHF) management, a condition characterized by high mortality, substantial economic burden, and frequent readmissions resulting from delayed symptom detection, suboptimal adherence, and limited patient self-management capacity. Synthesizing evidence from ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar, the paper argues that MAS—composed of autonomous, proactive, socially interactive agents—offer scalable infrastructures for distributed clinical monitoring, real-time symptom assessment, patient education, and coordination of guideline-based interventions across home-care and telemedicine environments. The authors detail key architectural considerations, including agent autonomy, mobility for interacting with dynamic patient contexts, secure communication protocols to preserve confidentiality, organizational alignment with clinical workflows, and modular design enabling integration with broader e-health ecosystems. Although the article does not present empirical datasets, computational benchmarks, or experimental validation, it positions MAS as a technically and clinically promising approach for managing the complexity of CHF by facilitating continuous data collection, intelligent decision support, and adaptive self-care reinforcement. The paper emphasizes that technical design alone is insufficient; effective MAS deployment requires addressing sociotechnical factors such as patient behavior, caregiver interactivity, clinical usability, and multi-stakeholder coordination. Major limitations include the absence of quantitative evaluation, lack of real-world deployment studies, uncharacterized scalability and robustness, and no formal comparison with existing telemonitoring solutions—highlighting the need for future research that couples MAS architectures with rigorous clinical validation, privacy-preserving data frameworks, and human-centered design methodologies.

- **"Modeling Malaria with Multi-Agent Systems"**, 2005  
  `multi-agent-systems, malaria, epidemiology, healthcare-modeling, education-intervention`
  — This study applies a multi-agent modeling paradigm to simulate malaria transmission dynamics in Haiti and to evaluate how educational interventions influence disease outcomes. Grounded in the complex-systems perspective, the authors construct a decentralized multi-agent model incorporating human populations, mosquito vectors, environmental conditions, and healthcare infrastructures. The model embeds realistic ecological constraints reflecting anopheles habitats (temperature ≥18°C, water presence, low pollution) and accounts for historical challenges such as insecticide resistance and antimalarial drug resistance. The authors run three experimental setups—(1) three hospitals, (2) three hospitals plus 20 schools, and (3) five hospitals plus 20 schools—executing 10 simulations for each scenario. Results demonstrate that education, when combined with expanded healthcare capacity, significantly reduces malaria mortality, highlighting the synergistic role of public health instruction and clinical access in disease control. Although the paper does not use external datasets or benchmark MAS platforms, and lacks formal quantitative evaluation metrics beyond mortality counts, it showcases the potential of multi-agent simulation to assess public-health strategies in resource-limited regions.

Overall, the work illustrates how MAS can capture the interplay between environment, healthcare infrastructure, and behavioral interventions, supporting more informed malaria-control planning.

  - **"Emerging Medical Informatics with Case-Based Reasoning for Aiding Clinical Decision in Multi-Agent System"**, 2015  
  `multi-agent-systems, clinical-decision-support, case-based-reasoning, ontology, knowledge-representation`
  — This paper presents a multi-agent clinical decision-support framework that integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) and ontological knowledge representation to address the inherent uncertainty of medical decision-making across diagnostic, prognostic, treatment, and therapeutic monitoring stages. The proposed MAS architecture coordinates heterogeneous agents—database agents, ontological agents, and CBR agents—to retrieve structured clinical information, interpret patient conditions, match similar historical cases, and recommend therapeutic strategies based on previously validated outcomes. The ontological agent extends domain hierarchies, interprets user-input clinical descriptions, and mediates the mapping between patient data and conceptual medical knowledge, while the CBR component stores, indexes, and restores experiential clinical cases to support classification problems (e.g., disease diagnosis) and optimization problems (e.g., selecting treatment under physical, pharmacological, and safety constraints). The system operates in a passive interaction mode, requiring users to describe symptoms and conditions before agents collaboratively generate suggestions; a supervisor agent oversees the workflow to formalize problems and evaluate alternative solutions. Although no experimental datasets, benchmarking metrics, or comparative evaluations are included, the paper demonstrates how combining MAS with CBR and ontologies can create a flexible, extensible decision-support pipeline capable of handling uncertainty and integrating human expertise. Limitations include lack of real-world deployment validation, absence of performance assessment, undefined scalability, and reliance on expert-driven knowledge engineering. Overall, the work positions MAS–CBR integration as a promising yet undervalidated approach for intelligent, knowledge-guided clinical decision support.

- **"Survey of Recent Results in Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms for Multi-Agent Systems"**, 2024

  — This survey provides a comprehensive overview of privacy-preserving mechanisms in cooperative multi-agent systems deployed across domains such as smart grids, autonomous vehicles, traffic management, wireless sensor networks, healthcare, financial systems, and social networks. The paper situates privacy as a core requirement for cooperative control, where agents must exchange only essential information while protecting sensitive local states from adversaries—including eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious agents capable of exploiting intercepted data. The review categorizes the literature into differential-privacy-based methods and encryption-based protocols, analyzing their respective strengths, limitations, computational costs, and impact on system performance, convergence speed, and tracking error. It highlights fundamental trade-offs between privacy and control efficiency, noting that stronger privacy often degrades consensus accuracy and slows system coordination. The paper discusses scenarios involving consensus, reference tracking, and formation control under communication constraints defined by network topology or time-varying connectivity. It further clarifies distinctions between privacy and security, emphasizing the need for protecting unobservable states even in benign cooperative settings. Key challenges identified include maintaining stability under noise injection, designing lightweight cryptographic protocols for resource-limited agents, managing heterogeneous adversarial models, and ensuring scalability in large networks. Although the survey does not introduce new algorithms or benchmarks, it consolidates current methodologies and outlines gaps—such as limited real-world validation, insufficient robustness analysis, and unclear guidelines for balancing privacy with control performance—thus motivating future development of more efficient and theoretically grounded privacy-preserving strategies for multi-agent cooperative control.

- **"Formal Analysis of Medical Systems using Multi-Agent Systems with Information Sharing"**, 2024  
  `multi-agent-systems, formal-verification, model-checking, medical-safety, Maude, iMAS`
  — This paper introduces a formal framework for modeling and verifying safety-critical medical systems using a multi-agent paradigm with information sharing, time-constrained communication, and timed agent migration. The authors define iMAS, a process-calculus-based language extending TiMo with explicit timeouts and distributed agent mobility, enabling precise representation of heterogeneous medical workflows in which agents hold both public and private information. Using a simplified but clinically realistic airway laser surgery scenario—where unsafe simultaneous activation of a ventilator and laser may cause burns, and low blood oxygen (SpO₂) risks shock—the study demonstrates how MAS can coordinate safety protocols through message passing and reactive behavior. An executable specification is implemented in the Maude rewriting engine, leveraging Maude’s strategy framework to constrain nondeterministic rule application, significantly reducing the explosion of possible system evolutions in concurrent settings. The authors then apply Maude’s model-checking tools to automatically verify safety properties, detect unsafe behavioral paths, and confirm correct agent coordination under time-sensitive conditions. While the work does not include empirical datasets or benchmark comparisons, it provides a rigorous method for validating MAS behavior in medical environments and highlights the value of formal verification for preventing procedural failures. Limitations include reliance on abstraction rather than full clinical system modeling, and the need for validation against real-world device interactions. Overall, the paper contributes a foundational approach for applying formal methods to ensure safety and correctness in intelligent, distributed medical systems.

Motivated by the limitations of traditional segmentation approaches—and the high manual workload required for expert-driven segmentation—the system leverages autonomous agents that interact, share local knowledge, resolve conflicts, and coordinate segmentation decisions in a decentralized manner. The MAS architecture provides an intelligent environment where contour agents and region agents cooperatively refine boundaries and identify regions of interest, addressing challenges such as image noise, complex anatomical structures, and heterogeneous visual content. The proposed system was evaluated on public medical imaging datasets and outperformed several classical segmentation methods, achieving accuracy of 93.51% ± 0.8, sensitivity of 93.53% ± 5.08, and specificity of 92.64% ± 4.01. The cooperative paradigm also yielded significant improvements in processing speed and segmentation stability compared to non-cooperative models. Although the method does not introduce new datasets or formal benchmarking protocols, it demonstrates the potential of MAS-driven coordination to strengthen hybrid segmentation pipelines and assist clinicians without replacing their expertise. Limitations include reliance on predefined agent behaviors, absence of deep-learning comparison baselines, and the need for broader validation across varied imaging modalities. Overall, the work highlights cooperation-based MAS as a powerful strategy for advanced medical image segmentation.

  — This paper presents an enhanced agent-based interoperability framework for healthcare environments, focusing on improving reliability, availability, and operational control in the AIDA (Agency for Integration, Diffusion and Archive of Medical Information) platform—an MAS deployed across multiple Portuguese hospitals. Recognizing that modern healthcare information systems are heterogeneous, independently developed, and difficult to integrate, the authors emphasize the need for continuous interoperation rather than simple system integration. The work introduces a new monitoring and control module that enables real-time supervision of agent behavior, early failure detection, activity auditing, and dynamic management of interoperability workflows. By providing an interface for administrators to track, configure, and deploy agents as hospital requirements evolve, the module addresses a critical gap in AIDA’s previous architecture. The methodology follows a design science research approach, culminating in deployment at Centro Hospitalar do Porto, where it improved operational efficiency, scheduling of maintenance tasks, and overall interoperability performance. Although the paper lacks benchmarking metrics or quantitative evaluations against alternative MAS middleware, it demonstrates the practical utility of agent monitoring for sustaining robust clinical information exchange.

  — This study conducts a comprehensive transparency audit of CE-certified Class IIb medical AI products for radiology in the EU, revealing substantial gaps between ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI and the publicly available documentation provided by vendors. Using a 55-item survey derived from established transparency frameworks—covering intended use, algorithmic development, training data characteristics, ethical considerations, validation processes, and deployment caveats—the authors evaluated 14 commercial AI tools by scoring the availability of critical information. Transparency scores ranged from 6.4% to 60.9% (median 29.1%), indicating pervasive deficiencies in reporting key aspects such as training data origin and representativeness, annotation procedures, demographic coverage, consent processes, safety monitoring, GDPR compliance, and ethical oversight. Very few products disclosed limitations for specific demographics or clinical environments, raising concerns about hidden risks, bias propagation, and inequitable performance. The study emphasizes that current principles for trustworthy AI lack enforceable mechanisms and that transparency cannot be meaningfully assessed without mandatory public disclosure requirements. Although the work relies on publicly available documentation and does not evaluate technical performance directly, it provides one of the first systematic analyses demonstrating that safety-critical medical AI products fail to meet basic transparency standards. The authors call for regulatory action to mandate substantive, publicly accessible transparency as a prerequisite for safe and equitable deployment of medical AI.

- **"Control of Unreasonable Growth of Medical Expenses in Public Hospitals in Shanghai, China: A Multi-Agent System Model"**, 2020  
  `multi-agent-systems, health-economics, policy-simulation, public-hospitals, healthcare-cost-control`
  — This study develops an agent-based simulation to analyze and mitigate the persistent and unreasonable rise of medical expenses in Chinese public hospitals by modeling interactions among key stakeholders—patients, physicians, hospitals, government regulators, and medical insurance agencies. The system integrates two subsystems: a disease and medical-seeking behavior module, and a medical-expenses generation module. Simulation experiments show that irrational patient preferences for tertiary hospitals, weak public-welfare incentives for physicians, and insufficient governmental financial investment are major drivers of cost escalation. Policy interventions such as strengthening community first-visit systems, improving physician compensation while reducing workload to curb over-prescription, and increasing governmental subsidies collectively outperform isolated interventions in reducing unnecessary expenditure growth. The MAS model demonstrates how coordinated behavioral adjustments across demand-side, supply-side, and regulatory agents can effectively constrain escalating medical costs, offering a quantitative decision-support tool for evidence-informed healthcare policy design in China.

The authors introduce two referential smart-lighting design patterns—Basic Smart Lighting (BSL) for low-density or resource-constrained settings, and Advanced Smart Lighting (ASL) for complex urban environments—each specifying sensor configurations, communication modules, and management rules. The system leverages fuzzy logic to manage uncertainty in sensor data (e.g., ambient light, traffic presence) and employs autonomous cooperative agents to orchestrate real-time brightness adjustment, fault detection, safety monitoring, and fire-response behaviors. A testbed IoT prototype demonstrates the feasibility of the approach, validating its ability to optimize energy usage, reduce CO₂ emissions, and enhance responsiveness compared to traditional lighting infrastructures. The framework highlights how MAS principles—autonomy, reactivity, and coordination—combined with IoT and fuzzy reasoning, provide a scalable and adaptable foundation for next-generation smart-city lighting systems.
