  — Utilises TCGA-BRCA WXS IG-CDR3 reads and web-tools (SitePrediction, AdaptiveMatch) to compute IG CDR3-MMP2 binding affinities and correlate higher affinity with improved overall survival.

- *"A Consensus Multi-View Multi-Objective Gene Selection Approach for Improved Sample Classification (CMVMC)"*, 2020, APBC,  
  `gene-selection, multi-omics, clustering, optimization, feature-selection`, [paper]  
  — Proposes CMVMC, a consensus multi-view multi-objective clustering-based feature selection method integrating gene expression, Gene Ontology (GO), and protein–protein interaction networks (PPIN) to identify non-redundant, biologically relevant genes for effective sample classification in human and yeast datasets.
